# Caching settings
cache:

  msToLive:
    default: 900000 # 15 minutes
  # Default 'Cache-Control' HTTP Header to set for all static content (including compiled *.js files)
  # Defaults to max-age=604,800 seconds (one week). This lets a user's browser know that it can cache these
  # files for one week, after which they will be "stale" and need to be redownloaded.
  # NOTE: When updates are made to compiled *.js files, it will automatically bypass this browser cache, because
  # all compiled *.js files include a unique hash in their name which updates when content is modified.

  # In-memory cache(s) of server-side rendered pages. These caches will store the most recently accessed public pages.
  # Pages are automatically added/dropped from these caches based on how recently they have been used.
  # Restarting the app clears all page caches.
  # NOTE: To control the cache size, use the "max" setting. Keep in mind, individual cached pages are usually small (<100KB).
  # Enabling *both* caches will mean that a page may be cached twice, once in each cache (but may expire at different times via timeToLive).
  serverSide:
    # Set to true to see all cache hits/misses/refreshes in your console logs. Useful for debugging SSR caching issues.

    # When enabled (i.e. max > 0), known bots will be sent pages from a server side cache specific for bots.

    botCache:
      # Maximum number of pages to cache for known bots. Set to zero (0) to disable server side caching for bots.
      # Default is 1000, which means the 1000 most recently accessed public pages will be cached.
      # As all pages are cached in server memory, increasing this value will increase memory needs.

      # Amount of time after which cached pages are considered stale (in ms). After becoming stale, the cached
      # copy is automatically refreshed on the next request.

      # For example, setting this to one week may mean that search engine bots may not find all new content for one week.

      # When set to false, after timeToLive expires, the next request will wait on SSR to complete & receive a fresh page (which is then saved to cache).
